        <h1>注意事项</h1>
        <p>滑雪是一项动感强烈、很富于刺激的体育运动。初学者首先应该学好基本的滑雪技术，要请一名富有经验的滑雪教练对你进行系统的培训。初学者在选择滑雪场地时，坡度不能太陡，6度左右最好，滑雪道要宽，50米左右为宜，要有乘坐式索道来运送滑雪者（牵引式索道不利于滑雪者休息），雪质要好，要有大型雪道机对雪面进行修整和保养，这一点对初学者很重要。</p>
        <p>Skiing is a very dynamic and exciting sport. Beginners should first learn the basic skills of skiing, to hire an experienced ski instructor to give you systematic training. Beginners in the choice of ski venue, the slope can not be too steep, about 6 degrees is the best, the ski to be wide, about 50 meters is appropriate, to have the type of ropeway to transport skiers (traction ropeway is not conducive to the rest of the skiers), snow quality is better, to have a large ski machine on the snow surface dressing and maintenance, this is very important for beginners.</p>
        <p>滑雪器材主要有滑雪板、杖、靴、各种固定器、滑雪蜡、滑雪装、 盔形帽、有色镜、防风镜等。通常滑雪场有器材出租,游客不妨租借。滑雪板分单板（SNOWBOARD）和双板（SKI）。初学者最好选用弹性好、长度短、雪板头较大些、轻便的滑雪板。滑雪装首先要考虑其防水防风雪的性能，其次是保温透气功能设计，防风裙设计，填充棉设计等，舒适合身、不妨碍行动及尽量减少风的阻力为原则。滑雪眼镜不可少。雪地上因阳光反射强烈，容易造成雪盲症，必须戴上雪镜来保护眼睛。镜架以塑胶制品较为安全；镜片颜色以黄色或茶色为佳。
            初到雪场时应先滑雪场的大概情况，要仔细了解一下雪道的高度、坡度、长度、宽度及周边的情况，根据自己的滑雪水平来选择相应的滑道。熟悉地图一雪场设施的分布位置，出事获救情况，并严格遵守滑雪场的有关安全管理的规定。注意索道开放时间，在无人看守时切勿乘坐。
            </p>
        <p>Ski equipment mainly includes skis, poles, boots, various fixers, ski wax, ski clothes, helmets, colored mirrors, windshields, etc. Usually ski resorts have equipment for rent, so tourists can rent it. There are two types of SNOWBOARD: snowboard and SKI. Beginners had better choose good elasticity, short length, ski head larger, light skis. Ski wear should first consider its waterproof and snowproof performance, followed by insulation and breathable function design, windproof skirt design, padded cotton design, comfortable fit, do not impede movement and minimize wind resistance as the principle. Ski glasses are a must. Because of strong sunlight reflection on snow, it is easy to cause snow blindness, so you must wear snow goggles to protect your eyes. The frame is safer with plastic products; Yellow or tawny lens color is preferred.
            First to the ski resort should be the general situation of the ski resort, to carefully understand the height of the piste, slope, length, width and surrounding situation, according to their own skiing level to choose the corresponding slide. Familiar with the map of the location of the ski resort facilities, accident rescue situation, and strictly abide by the relevant safety management regulations of the ski resort. Pay attention to the opening hours of the ropeway and do not ride when unguarded.</p>
        <p>滑雪场的温度比较低，寒冷空气会刺激支气管，影响每次呼吸的质量；另外滑行中有些人感觉冷风对脸部的刺激太厉害，会选择一个只露出双眼的头套，再加一个全封闭型滑雪镜，将面部完全罩住，能有效阻止冷风对面部的侵入，这也同时影响了人体对氧气的吸入量，时间一长就会导致人体缺氧而出现不适应症状，建议服用携氧片，一方面可以提高血红细胞的载氧能力，提高氧效；另一方面提高人体器官的缺氧耐受力，能让人体在低氧环境下正常生存。</p>
        <p>The temperature of the ski resort is relatively low, and the cold air can irritate the bronchi, affecting the quality of each breath; In addition, some people feel the stimulation of cold wind on the face is too severe, they will choose a head cover with only their eyes exposed, and add a fully closed ski goggles to cover the face completely, which can effectively prevent the invasion of cold wind on the face, which also affects the amount of oxygen inhalation of the human body. After a long time, the human body will suffer from hypoxia and maladaptive symptoms, it is recommended to take oxygen carrying tablets. On the one hand, it can improve the oxygen-carrying capacity and oxygen efficiency of red blood cells. On the other hand, improve the hypoxia tolerance of human organs, so that the human body can survive normally in the hypoxic environment.</p>
